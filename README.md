# 🏆 Machine Learning-Based Email Spam Detection System

📧 A smart email classification system built with Python, designed to accurately detect spam emails and distinguish them from legitimate (ham) emails. The system leverages NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF features, and Naive Bayes modeling to provide reliable predictions in real-time.

## 🚀 Features
- **Spam Detection** – Classifies emails as spam or ham with high accuracy  
- **Interactive UI** – Streamlit-based web interface for easy testing and predictions  
- **Model Persistence** – Trained model and vectorizer saved using Pickle for reproducible deployment  
- **Preprocessing Pipeline** – Tokenization, stop-word removal, and text cleaning for robust feature extraction  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 🐍**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **NLTK** – Text preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning (Multinomial Naive Bayes)  
- **Streamlit** – Web app framework  

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses a **[Spam Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)** containing labeled emails classified as spam or ham (non-spam), used for training and evaluating the model.
